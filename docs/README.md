# Paytrail Payment API

This is the API reference and example documentation for the new [Paytrail](https://www.paytrail.com/) Payment API.

OpenAPI 3 specification for the API is also [available for download](paytrail-api.yaml ':ignore').

If you have any feedback regarding how we could improve the documentation, [please file an issue on Github](https://github.com/paytrail/api-documentation/issues). You can also ask for support by opening an issue on GitHub. Thank you!

[Old Paytrail API reference](https://old-docs.paytrail.com/#/) and [Checkout Finland API reference](https://checkoutfinland.github.io/psp-api/#/) are available separately.

## API endpoint

API endpoint is `services.paytrail.com`.

## Authentication

All API calls need to be signed using HMAC and SHA-256 or SHA-512. When a request contains a body, the body must be valid JSON and a `content-type` header with the value `application/json; charset=utf-8` must be included.

All API responses are signed the same way, allowing merchant to verify response validity. In addition, the responses contain `request-id` header. Saving or logging the value of this header is recommended.

The signature is transmitted in the `signature` HTTP header. Signature payload consists of the following fields separated with a line feed (`\n`). Carriage returns (`\r`) are not supported.

- All `checkout-` headers in alphabetical order. The header keys must be in lowercase. Each header key and value are separated with `:`
- HTTP body in exactly the same format as it will be sent, or empty string if no body

The headers are:

| Field                     | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `platform-name`           | string  | For SaaS services, use the marketing name of the platform (for example, `shopify`). For third party eCommerce platform plugins, use the platform name and your identifier, like company name (for example, `woocommerce-yourcompany`). Platform and integrator information helps customer service to provide better assistance for the merchants using the integration. |

The HTTP verb, nonce and timestamp are used to mitigate various replay and timing attacks. Below is an example payload passed to a HMAC function:

```
checkout-account:1234\n
checkout-algorithm:sha256\n
checkout-method:POST\n
checkout-nonce:1234\n
checkout-timestamp:2018-07-05T11:19:25.950Z\n
REQUEST BODY
```

See also code examples of [HMAC calculation in node.js](/examples#hmac-calculation-nodejs) and [HMAC calculation in PHP](/examples#hmac-calculation-php).

### Test credentials

Please note that not all payment methods support testing, so only the payment methods that support testing payments are enabled for these credentials. Provider specific credentials for approving payments can be found from [providers tab](/payment-method-providers#test-credentials). Payments created with test accounts will be removed daily which means older payments cannot be refunded.

#### Normal merchant account

- Merchant ID: `375917`
- Secret key: `SAIPPUAKAUPPIAS`

#### Shop-in-Shop merchant account

_Note:_ Use these only if you are setting up a [Shop-in-Shop](https://www.checkout.fi/vinkkipankki/mita-shop-in-shop-kauppapaikat-ovat) web shop.

- Aggregate merchant ID: `695861`
- Aggregate secret key: `MONISAIPPUAKAUPPIAS`
- Shop-in-Shop merchant ID: `695874`

When opening a shop-in-shop payment, the request is signed with the aggregate merchant ID and secret key. Each item in a shop-in-shop payment request must list a valid shop-in-shop merchant ID. Aggregate merchant cannot be used in items.

### Redirect and callback URL signing

Return and callback URL parameters are also signed, and the merchant _must_ check the signature validity. The signature is calculated the same way as for requests, but the values come in as query string parameters instead of headers. Empty string is used for the body.

## Payments

Actions related to the payment object are mapped to `/payments` API endpoint.

The following illustrates how the user moves in the payment process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

Client ->> Merchant: Proceed to checkout

opt Without opening a new payment before client proceeds
Merchant ->> services.paytrail.com: List methods (GET /merchants/payment-providers)
services.paytrail.com ->> Merchant: Suitable payment methods
Merchant ->> Client: Render suitable payment methods
Client ->> Merchant: Select a payment method
end

Merchant ->> services.paytrail.com: Initiate new payment (POST /payments)
services.paytrail.com ->> Merchant: JSON with payment methods
Merchant ->> Client: Render payment method buttons
Client ->> Payment method provider: Submits chosen payment form
Payment method provider -->> Client: Redirect to Paytrail success/cancel URL
Client -->> services.paytrail.com: success/cancel

opt Callback URL
services.paytrail.com->> Merchant: Call success/cancel callback URL
end

services.paytrail.com -->> Client: Redirect to Merchant success/cancel URL
Client ->> Merchant: Return to success/cancel
Merchant ->> Client: Render thank you -page
```

### Create

`HTTP POST /payments` creates a new open payment and returns a JSON object that includes the available payment methods. The merchant web shop renders HTML forms from the response objects (see [example](/examples#payment-provider-form-rendering)). The client browser will submit the form to the payment method provider.

Once the payment has been completed the client browser will return to the merchant provided redirect URL.

[List providers](#list-providers) endpoint can be used to receive available payment methods without opening a new payment.

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Redirect and callback URL parameters

Once the payment is complete, or cancelled, the client browser is normally redirected to the merchant provided URL. If merchant has provided a callback URL, it will be called too. The callback is called with `HTTP GET` and with the same query string parameters as in the redirect. The callback URL should respond with `HTTP 20x`.

!> The URLs may be called multiple times. The merchant web shop must be able to handle multiple requests for the same purchase.

The payment information is available in the query string parameters of the client request. For example, if the `redirectUrls.success` value was `https://example.org`, it would be accessed with parameters appended:

```
https://example.org?checkout-account=375917&checkout-algorithm=sha256&checkout-amount=2964&checkout-stamp=15336332710015&checkout-reference=192387192837195&checkout-transaction-id=4b300af6-9a22-11e8-9184-abb6de7fd2d0&checkout-status=ok&checkout-provider=nordea&signature=b2d3ecdda2c04563a4638fcade3d4e77dfdc58829b429ad2c2cb422d0fc64080
```

The query string parameters are listed below. If callback URLs were provided, same parameters are used.

| `checkout-provider`       | string  | The payment method provider the client used. Current values are documented on [providers tab](/payment-method-providers#test-credentials). The values are subject to change without notice.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `signature`               | string  | HMAC signature calculated from other parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Merchant must check that signature is valid. Signature is calculated as described [above](#redirect-and-callback-url-signing). **Do not** implement the HMAC validation with hardcoded query string parameters since new ones may be added later. Instead, filter parameters by name (include all that begin with `checkout-`), then sort, and calculate the HMAC.

##### Statuses

The currently possible payment statuses are:

| `pending` | Payment was initially approved by the provider but further processing is required, for example anti-fraud check is ongoing or invoice requires manual activation.                                                                        |
| `delayed` | A rare status related to a single payment method that is not generally enabled. May take days to complete. If completed, will be reported as `ok` via the callback _or_ the redirect URL. This can be handled the same way as `pending`. |

### Get

`HTTP GET /payments/{transactionId}` returns payment information.

Get transaction info. Payments are reported primarily via callbacks, and implementations should mainly rely on receiving the info via them. All received payments will be eventually reported.

<b>Note!</b> The transaction id needs to be sent on checkout-transaction-id header as well.

See [example response](/examples#get) from examples tab.

### Refund

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/refund` refunds a payment by transaction ID.

?>
Refunds can be asynchronous. Technically this means that when a refund request is accepted, the response may contain status `pending`. Later, when the refund is processed, the callback will be called with the actual outcome. At the moment, this only applies to email refunds but might be implemented for other types later.

#### Request

See detailed description from [refund payment request body section](#refund-payment).

```json
{
  "amount": 1590,
  "refundStamp": "88907910-7b85-4940-8563-202b93d5ca79",
  "refundReference": "your reference",
  "callbackUrls": {
    "success": "https://ecom.example.org/refund/success",
    "cancel": "https://ecom.example.org/refund/cancel"
  }
}
```

#### Response

| Status code | Explanation                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 201         | Refund request received                               |
| 400         | Something went wrong                                  |
| 422         | Used payment method provider does not support refunds |

Note, that at the moment HTTP 400 may occur also for 3rd party reasons - e.g. because Nordea test API does not support refunds. See all provider limitations from [providers tab](/payment-method-providers#refunds).

```json
{
  "provider": "handelsbanken",
  "status": "ok",
  "transactionId": "258ad3a5-9711-44c3-be65-64a0ef462ba3"
}
```

### Email refunds

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/refund/email` email refunds a payment by transaction ID.

?>
Email refunds are always asynchronous. Technically this means that when a refund request is accepted, the response contain status `pending`. Later, when the customer has entered their bank details and the refund is processed, the callback will be called with the actual outcome.

See detailed description from [refund payment request body section](#refund-payment).

```json
{
  "amount": 1590,
  "email": "recipient@example.com",
  "refundStamp": "bd71d096-94b6-4e1b-b4a3-d7cea73738ac",
  "refundReference": "your reference",
  "callbackUrls": {
    "success": "https://ecom.example.org/success",
    "cancel": "https://ecom.example.org/cancel"

## Apple Pay

**The Apple Pay button is rendered separately from other payment methods on the frontend**, as it requires custom JavaScript ran on the browser. Paytrail's Apple Pay implementation however uses the same [Payment Create-response](#response) which is already used for creating the payment wall.

Paytrail provides a frontend library **paytrail.js** which makes implementing Apple Pay to your existing Paytrail payment wall simple.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to:

- **Enable Apple Pay for your merchant** in [Paytrail Merchant Panel > Payment Methods](https://merchant.paytrail.com/trades/methods).
  - After Apple Pay is enabled for your merchant, your [Payments Create-response's](#response) `customProviders`-field will contain parameters for your Apple Pay implementation, which are used later in [Step 1.](#3-mount-an-apple-pay-button-to-the-html-element)
- **Serve your frontend application over HTTPS.** This is a requirement both in development and production. For development, we recommend serving your localhost server with [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/).
- [**Verify your domain with Apple Pay**](#verifying-your-domain-with-apple-pay), both in development and production.

Additionally, development and testing should be done on an **MacOS or iOS Safari browser**, as other browsers do not support Apple Pay and will not render the Apple Pay button.

#### Verifying your domain with Apple Pay

To use Apple Pay, you need to register with Apple all of your web domains that will show an Apple Pay button. This includes both top-level domains (e.g., **exampleshop.com**) and subdomains (e.g., **shop.example.com**). You need to do this for domains you use in both production and testing. When testing locally, use a tool like [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/) to get an HTTPS domain.

Next follow these steps:

- Download [**this domain association file**](https://pay.paytrail.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association) and host it at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your site.
  - For example, if you're registering https://example.com, make that file available at https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.
- Next, go to Paytrail Merchant Panel and add your domain to the registered Apple Pay domains.

_**Important note:** Apple’s documentation for Apple Pay on the Web describes their process of “merchant validation”, which Paytrail handles for you behind the scenes. You **do not** need to create an Apple Merchant ID, CSR, etc., as described in their documentation, and should instead just follow the two steps above._

Now we are ready to implement Apple Pay to your store page.

### 1. Set up paytrail.js & HTML-element

First include **paytrail.js** in your page:

```html
<script src="https://services.paytrail.com/static/paytrail.js"></script>
```

Then add an `#apple-pay-button` -element to your site, and generate parameter `<input>`-elements inside it from the [Payments Create-response's](#response) `customProviders.applepay`-field:

#### PHP

```php
<div id="apple-pay-button">
  <?php foreach ($response->customProviders->applepay->parameters as $param) : ?>
    <input type="hidden" name="<?=$param->name?>" value="<?=$param->value?>">
  <?php endforeach; ?>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript

```javascript
const applePayParameters = response.customProviders.applepay.parameters;

const responseToApplePayHtml = (response) =>
  `<div id="apple-pay-button">
    ${applePayParameters.map((param) => `<input type='hidden' name='${param.name}' value='${param.value}' />`)}
  </div>`;
```

### 2. Style your Apple Pay -button

**Add CSS styles to the Apple Pay -button.** The styles below are an example of a simple white Apple Pay -button, but you can style it to fit your site. More information on styling can be found from [the Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/displaying_apple_pay_buttons).

```html
<style>
  #apple-pay-button {
    display: none;
    -webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button;
    -apple-pay-button-type: plain;
    -apple-pay-button-style: white-outline;
    height: 50px;
    width: 100%;
  }
</style>
```

_**Note:** In production, the button should be hidden by default with `display: none;`, as the button will be displayed with **paytrail.js** in the next step. For development purposes however, the button can be displayed with `display: block;`._

### 3. Mount an Apple Pay button to the HTML element

Finally, we need to mount the button element using **paytrail.js**. Mounting will display the button and add on-click -actions to initiate payment.

```javascript
const applePayButton = checkoutFinland.applePayButton;

// canMakePayment() checks that the user is on a Safari browser which supports Apple Pay.
if (applePayButton.canMakePayment()) {
  // Mount the button to the element you created earlier, here e.g. #apple-pay-button.
  applePayButton.mount('#apple-pay-button', (redirectUrl) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.replace(redirectUrl);
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```

_**Note:** The callback given to `mount()` is called on a successful payment, and is called with the merchants (your) Paytrail success redirect url. You can customize the actions after a successful payment. The example callback above will redirect the user to the success url after 1.5 seconds, to give time for the Apple Pay modal success-animation to finish._

## Token payments

Paytrail provides an API for tokenizing payment cards and issuing payments on those tokenized payment cards.

For developing purposes there is [list of cards](/payment-method-providers#test-cards-for-tokenization) which can be safely used to test different scenarios on tokenization and payment flows (e.g. failing payments or using of 3DS).

### Adding (tokenizing) cards

Adding a new card stores the payment card information to Paytrail and returns a tokenization id that can be used to fetch a card token for payments.

The following illustrates how the user moves in the card tokenization process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

Client ->> Merchant backend: Initialize adding card
Merchant backend -->> Client: Paytrail add card form request details
Client ->> services.paytrail.com: Request add card form (POST /tokenization/addcard-form)
services.paytrail.com -->> Client: HTTP 302 Redirect to add card form
Client ->> Card addition form: Redirect to add card form
Card addition form -->> services.paytrail.com: HTTP 302 Redirect to Paytrail service

alt success
services.paytrail.com -->> Merchant backend: HTTP 302 Redirect to Merchant success URL with 'checkout-tokenization-id'
Merchant backend ->> services.paytrail.com: Tokenize with tokenization id (POST /tokenization/{checkout-tokenization-id})
services.paytrail.com -->> Merchant backend: Card token
Merchant backend ->> Merchant backend: Save token to DB
Merchant backend -->> Client: display success view
else failure
services.paytrail.com -->> Merchant backend: HTTP 302 Redirect to Merchant failure URL
Merchant backend -->> Client: display failure view
end

```

### Add card form

`HTTP POST /tokenization/addcard-form` is a form post requested from the user's browser. On a successful request the user will be redirected to Paytrail's card addition service where user will input credit card information.

<b>Note!</b> Authentication is done with form parameters, no headers are used for authentication. All authentication fields are listed below.

#### Response

On a successful request, user is `HTTP 302` redirected to Paytrail's card addition form page.

### Get token

`HTTP POST /tokenization/{checkout-tokenization-id}` is requested after the merchant has received a `checkout-tokenization-id` from the success redirect URL parameters, or the callback URL request if given.

Tokenization id must be also set on request header.

| field                      | info   | required           | description     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `checkout-tokenization-id` | string | <center>x</center> | Tokenization id |

This request returns the actual card token which can then be used to make payments on the card.

#### Request

No request body required.

#### Response

If tokenization is successful, `HTTP 200` and the `token` of the card is returned along with [card details](#card).

This token is used to make authorization holds and charges on the payment card.

### Charging a token

After the introduction of the European PSD2 directive, the electronic payment transactions are categorised in so called [customer initiated transactions (CIT)](#customer-initiated-transactions-cit) and [merchant initiated transactions (MIT)](#merchant-initiated-transactions-mit).

Customer initiated transactions are scenarios, where the customer actively takes part in the payment process.

Merchant initiated transactions are payments triggered without the customer's participation. This kind of transactions can be used for example in scenarios where the final price is not known at the time of the purchase or the customer is not present when the charge is made. A prior agreement, or "mandate" between the customer and the merchant is required.

Merchants can either [initialize direct charges or authorization holds](#create-authorization-hold-or-charge) (which need to be [committed](#commit-authorization-hold) later with a separate request).

#### Customer Initiated Transactions (CIT)

When charging a token using customer initiated transaction, applicable exemptions are attempted in order to avoid the need for strong customer authentication, 3D Secure. These exemptions may include but are not limited to: low-value (under 30 EUR) or transaction risk analysis.

Regardless, there is always a possibility the card issuer requires strong customer authentication by requesting a step-up. In this case, the response will contain "soft decline" result code 403 and an URL, where the customer needs to be redirected to, in order to perform the authentication.

After the user has authenticated with 3DS, the user is redirected to Paytrail services and an authorization hold on the user card is created. If the merchants initial request is a direct charge request, the payment is also committed from the card. Finally, Paytrail redirects the user back to the merchant URL.

The following illustrates how the user moves in the token payment process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

Client ->> Merchant backend: Pay with tokenized card
Merchant backend ->> services.paytrail.com: Create payment (POST /payments/token/cit/[charge|authorization-hold])

alt success
services.paytrail.com -->> Merchant backend: HTTP 201, transaction ID
end

alt 3DS required
services.paytrail.com -->> Merchant backend: HTTP 403, transaction ID & 3DS redirect url
Merchant backend -->> Client: Redirect user to 3DS
Client ->> 3DS Server: Redirect user to 3DS
3DS Server -->> services.paytrail.com: 3DS result

alt success
Note over Client,services.paytrail.com: Authorization hold created on card

    alt direct charge
      services.paytrail.com ->> services.paytrail.com: Commit authorization hold
    end

end
end

services.paytrail.com -->> Client: Redirect to Merchant success/cancel URL
Client ->> Merchant backend: Return to success/cancel
Merchant backend ->> Client: Render view based on result (e.g. Thank You -page)

```

#### Merchant Initiated Transactions (MIT)

This method should be used when charging the customer's card in a context, where the customer is not actively participating in the transaction.

The MIT transactions are exempt from the strong customer authentication requirements of PSD2, thus the payment cannot receive the "soft decline" response (code 403), unlike in the case of customer initiated transactions.

#### Create authorization hold or charge

`HTTP POST /payments/token/{mit|cit}/{authorization-hold|charge}` creates either an authorization hold or direct charge for MIT and CIT payments.

If creating an authorization hold, the payment needs to be committed later with a request to the [Commit API](#commit-authorization-hold).

<b>Note!</b> The transaction id needs to be sent on checkout-transaction-id header as well.

##### Request

The commit request body schema is the same as the one used for [creating payments](#create-request-body) expect with the addition of a the new token field (which must also be included as part of HMAC calculation):

| field | info   | required           | description        |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| token | string | <center>x</center> | Payment card token |

##### Response

If authorization hold or charge is successful, `HTTP 201` and the `transactionId` of the payment is returned.

When creating CIT authorization holds or direct charges the payment might need a 3DS step-up. In these cases `HTTP 403` along with the `transactionId` and `threeDSecureUrl` is returned. When this happens, the merchant must redirect user to the given `threeDSecureUrl` for secure authorization and further redirect. See documentation [here](#customer-initiated-transactions-cit).

| field           | type   | description                             |
| --------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| transactionId   | string | Assigned transaction ID for the payment |
| threeDSecureUrl | string | 3DS redirect URL                        |

#### Commit authorization hold

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/token/commit` commits an existing authorization hold.

A successful commit will charge the payer's card.

<b>Note!</b> The transaction id needs to be set on checkout-transaction-id header as well.

##### Request

The commit request body schema is the same as the one used for [creating the initial authorization hold](#create-authorization-hold-or-charge).

The final amount committed can either equal or be less than the authorization hold. The committed amount may not exceed the authorization hold.

The final items may differ from the ones used when creating the authorization hold.

##### Response

Commit will return `HTTP 201` when successful, and the `transactionId` of the payment.

| field         | type   | description                             |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| transactionId | string | Assigned transaction ID for the payment |

#### Revert authorization hold

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/token/revert` reverts an existing authorization hold.

A successful revert will remove the authorization hold from the payer's card.

<b>Note!</b> The transaction id needs to be set on checkout-transaction-id header as well.

##### Request

No request body required.

##### Response

Revert will return `HTTP 200` when successful, and the `transactionId` of the payment.

| field         | type   | description                             |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| transactionId | string | Assigned transaction ID for the payment |

## Invoices

### Manually activating invoices

Paytrail provides customer an option to pay with invoice. For certain invoice payment methods (currently only Walley/Collector), it is possible to activate the invoice manually later. This can be used for example with preordered products.

#### Payment creation to pending status

Payment needs to be created with the `manualInvoiceActivation` flag set to true. If paid with invoice, the payment will be left to `pending` status and invoice will not be activated automatically.

#### Activating invoice

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/activate-invoice` manually activates invoice by transaction ID. Can only be used if payment was paid with Walley/Collector and is in pending status.

##### Request

No request body required.

##### Response

Activation will return `HTTP 200` when successful.

| field   | type   | description                                   |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| status  | string | Status of activation. `ok` or `error`         |
| message | string | Response details, eg. detailed error message. |

## Payment Reports

Paytrail provides an API for asynchronous payment report generation. A merchant can view their payments in this report. A call to the endpoint must contain a callback URL where the payment report will be delivered to once it has been generated.

The endpoint supports specifying whether the result will be delivered as a JSON payload or as a CSV file. It also supports field filtering and some result filtering.

A Shop-in-Shop aggregate merchant can also fetch its submerchant's payment report.

### Payment report request

`HTTP POST /payments/report` results in a callback containing the payment report.

## Merchants

Actions related to merchants are mapped under `/merchants` API endpoint.

### List providers

`HTTP GET /merchants/payment-providers` returns a list of available providers for the merchant. This endpoint can be used for example to show available payment methods in checkout without initializing a new payment before the user actually proceeds to pay their order.

#### HTTP GET query parameters

| Field  | Type                                        | Required           | Example           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Some payment methods have minimum or maximum purchase limits. When the amount is provided, only the methods suitable for the amount are returned. Otherwise, all merchant's payment methods are returned. |

Example

```
/merchants/payment-providers?amount=1000&groups=mobile,creditcard
```

### List grouped providers

`HTTP GET /merchants/grouped-payment-providers` is similar to the `List providers`-endpoint, but in addition of returning a flat list of providers, it returns payment group data containing localized group names, icons for the groups and grouped providers. Returns also a localized text with a link to the terms of payment.

#### Response body

The response JSON object contains the transaction ID of the payment and list of provider forms. It is highly recommended to render the icons and forms in the shop, but if this is not possible the response also contains a link to the hosted payment gateway. The response contains also HMAC verification headers and `cof-request-id` header. Storing or logging the request ID header is advised for possible debug needs.
