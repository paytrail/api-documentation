## Provider limitations

### General limitations

Some payment method providers have minimum and/or maximum amounts for the purchases. These are not currently enforced by the API for other than OP Lasku.

### Refunds

API refunds have been implemented for all providers supporting them. Currently payments created by the following methods can be refunded only with email refunds due to their lack of a refund API:

- S-pankki
- Ålandsbanken

There can be limitations in the refund APIs too, eg. Nordea API allows to refund only once per payment, and only for payments created less than 13 weeks earlier.

#### Refunds with test account

In addition to the limitations above, the following restrictions apply for refunding test account payments:

- Nordea refunds do not work
- Aktia refunds do not work
- PayPal refunds do not work
